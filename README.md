## Insights
The analysis reveals a consistent increase in tax collections from 2010 to 2023, reflecting strong economic activity and improved tax compliance over time. City tax collections form the major revenue portion, indicating higher taxable activity in urban regions compared to parish areas. Vehicle-related taxes in parishes also show a noticeable upward trend, suggesting growth in transportation activity and asset ownership.

## Conclusion
This project successfully analyzes and visualizes city and parish tax collections over time, providing meaningful insights into revenue trends and economic activity. The data shows steady growth in tax revenue from 2010 to 2023, supported by stable urban contributions and increasing vehicle-related taxes in parish areas. Seasonal patterns and annual fluctuations are clearly highlighted, enabling better forecasting and planning.
